## Installation

```
conda create -n envt2v python=3.8
conda activate envt2v
pip install torch==1.12.0+cu113 torchvision==0.13.0+cu113 torchaudio==0.12.0 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

You  also need to ensure that your system has installed the `ffmpeg` command. If it is not installed, you can install it using the following command:
```
sudo apt-get update && apt-get install ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6  -y
```

## Download pretrained weights
Run script:

```
bash download_model.sh
```

After running the script, weights are placed in models:

## Training Datasets

Place your videos in ``data/videos``<br>
![Alt text](doc/image.png)


Place your video paths and prompts in ``data/vid_list.txt``<br>
![Alt text](doc/image-2.png)


## Train your text-to-video model

```
python train_net.py --cfg configs/cfg_train.yaml
```

- During the training, you can view the saved models and intermediate inference results in the `workspace/experiments/cfg_train`directory.

## Test Datasets

Place your prompts in ``data/test_prompts.txt``<br>
![Alt text](doc/image-3.png)


## Inference

After the training is completed, you can perform inference on the model using the following command.
- Notice that you need to specify the path of the trained model in ``configs/cfg_infer.yaml``<br>
![Alt text](doc/image-4.png)
```
python inference.py --cfg configs/cfg_infer.yaml
```

Then you can find the videos you generated in the ``workspace/experiments/test_prompts`` directory.
